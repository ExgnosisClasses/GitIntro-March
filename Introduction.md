## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Please tell me:

- Name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Any experience you have with git or similar products.
- Any specific objectives for the class or specific items you want to learn.


## About the class

Because we have a lot of topics to cover in a short period of time, there will be no hands-on labs during the class.

Instead, the class will consist of some presentation and a lot of demos to illustrate the main points.

There is a git lab document that essentially describes the demos so that you can try them out for yourself after the class.
