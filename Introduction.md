## Introductions

Please introduce yourself briefly, we don't have a lot of time for this part. Please tell me:

- Name you prefer to be called in class if different from the one listed on the class list
- Your area of professions focus (developer, SRE, tester, BA, hardware engineer, etc.)
- Any experience you have with git or similar products.
- Any specific objectives for the class or specific items you want to learn.


## About the class

Because we have a lot of topics to cover in a short period of time, there will be no hands-on labs during the class.

Instead, the class will consist of some presentation and a lot of demos to illustrate the main points.

There is a git lab document that essentially describes the demos so that you can try them out for yourself after the class.

### Git internals

Previous SCV systems were often developed during the 1980s and 1990s when computing power and storage were limited. This means the delta approach was more efficient for storing large documents with small changes across many versions.

One of the problems with distributed repositories is maintaining the integrity of the commites. With a centralized repository, this is not a problem since items are checked out on a file by file basis.

If the entire repo is checked out, mutilated and then pushed back to the central repo, it has the potential to corrupt and destroy everything.

By using a certificate signing approach, the signature for each commit incorporates the signature of the previous commit so that there is a way to prevent random, spurious or malicious commits.
